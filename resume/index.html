        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                I'm currently studying at MacEwan University, graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce in April 2022, with a major in Business Law and minors in both Accounting and Psychology. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in game development, with the ultimate goal of working as a designer or producer.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                I've worked part-time during the school year and full-time otherwise since I was 14, giving me 8 years of work experience. With this, I've proven to be an effective worker and feel confident and capable in the basics of any position; I can collaborate with diverse groups of people, work quickly and meticulously, build efficiencies into systems to streamline work processes, and provide excellent customer service. I also learn new systems quickly, and once established I seek continuous improvement, because there's always room for growth.        </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                Beyond that, I have a special interest in the design and function of systems, ranging from law and business to games and narratives. In my free time, I explore this by designing game systems and leading friends through collaborative storytelling and roleplaying games. I also participated in two Game Jams this year, where I was credited as producer/project manager and level designer.        </p>
